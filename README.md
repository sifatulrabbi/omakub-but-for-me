# Omakub _but for me_

> This is not for anyone who wants to try [Omakub from DHH](https://omakub.org). Its my modified version of Omakub so that I don't always have to tweak it afterwards. To try out Omakub visit [Omakub.org](https://omakub.org).

Turn a fresh Ubuntu installation into a fully-configured, beautiful, and modern web development system by running a single command. That's the one-line pitch for Omakub. No need to write bespoke configs for every essential tool just to get started or to be up on all the latest command-line tools. Omakub is an opinionated take on what Linux can be at its best.
