**This is not for anyone who wants to try [Omakub from DHH](https://omakub.org). Its my modified version of Omakub so that I don't always have to tweak it afterwards. To try out Omakub watch the introduction video and read more at [omakub.org](https://omakub.org).**

## Start the setup

```bash
wget -qO- https://sifatulrabbi.com/omakub | bash
